\chapter{Instructions for use}
\label{chap:use}

Here is how to use a theoretical, fully functional, production \textit{Neglect
  No More} system.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Download the LeftAware app by scanning the QR code corresponding to your device.\\
  \textit{[A diagram here will include those QR codes. However, for our
    project, we are unable to create these mobile apps due to (a) time
    constraints and (b) budgetary constraints.]}
\item Create a user profile on the app.
\item Plug in the battery to the \textit{RotaSense} (attached to the
  \textit{Blinky}).
\item Press ``Okay'' when your phone prompts you to connect to the
  microcontroller.
\item Periodically check your phone to calibrate the microcontroller.
\item You're all set!
\end{enumerate}
