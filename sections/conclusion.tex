\label{chap:conclusion}

To summarize, our design and its function in the larger class solution meet the
key needs of the users. The key components of our design are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item An accelerometer/gyroscope sensor that is capable of tracking the head
  movements of the user.
\item An ESP32 microcontroller that provides bluetooth capability, allowing the
  design to communicate information on the user’s head movements to the mobile
  application and haptic clip.
\item Communication protocols that allow for high speed and low energy
  communication with the other teams’ components.
\end{itemize}

The users need a solution that is customizable and adjustable, and the feedback
component provides this by collecting information on the user’s movements so
that the stimuli from the glasses and haptic clip can be modified to make sure
the user is looking completely to their left. In addition, it was required that
the solution be lightweight and ideally wearable, and the design meets this
need because it is small enough to fit on a glasses strap and the prototype
weighs less than \qty{100}{\g}. Lastly, it was important that the solution be
affordable, and our design is affordable, as the prototype can be built for a
total cost of \$28.
