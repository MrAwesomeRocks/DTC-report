\label{chap:conclusion}

To summarize, our design and its function in the larger class solution meet the key needs of the users. The key components of our design are as follows:

an accelerometer gyroscope sensor that is capable of tracking the head movements of the user
an ESP 32 controller that provides bluetooth capability, allowing the design to communicate information on the user’s head movements to the mobile application and haptic clip

The users need a solution that is customizable and adjustable, and the feedback component provides this by collecting information on the user’s movements so that the stimuli from the glasses and haptic clip can be modified to make sure the user is looking completely to their left. In addition, it was required that the solution be lightweight and ideally wearable, and the design meets this need because it is small enough to fit on a pair of glasses and the parts (the gyroscope and ESP 32) weigh only \todo{weight} X g combined. Lastly, it was important that the solution be affordable, and our design is affordable, as it can be built for a total cost of \todo{cost} X.
