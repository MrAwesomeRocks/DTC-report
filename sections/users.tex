\section{Main Users of the Design}

Adults who are experiencing Left-Side Neglect: The user for our design will be patients at the Shirley Ryan Rehabilitation Center who have suffered a brain injury leaving them with the inability to turn their head past the midline of the body. They need cues/reminders from a caretaker in order to remember to continue turning their head all the way to the left past the midline. They would like a solution that does not rely on the caretaker in order to create more autonomy for the patient as well as just be overall easy to use. 

\section{Requirements}

We identified the following requirements during the course of the quarter. The design had to be: 

\subsection{Lightweight:}
The device will be attached to the pair of glasses and therefore must be light enough to comfortably fit on the glasses and not put too much weight on the patient. It must be small enough to fit onto the glasses and not make them lopsided. 

\subsection{Durable:}
Since the device is attached to the glasses that will be worn frequently by the user, the device must be able to endure being worn as well as have a long battery life. The device must be element resistant since the patient must be able to wear the glasses outside and must be able to be dropped from a small height in case the glasses fall off the patients face or are dropped off a surface.
