Instructions for construction
Follow the schematic listed below. Using a breadboard is easiest, but construction can be done with jumper wires too.


[[ SCHEMATIC GOES HERE ITS A PDF ]]
Instructions for use
[[ COORDINATE WITH OTHER TEAMS ]]


Tentative Instructions
1. Download the [app name] app by scanning the QR code corresponding to your device
[A diagram here will include those QR codes. However, for our project, we are unable to create these mobile apps due to (a) time constraints and (b) budgetary constraints.]
2. Create a user profile on the app
[Once the design is finalized, a screenshot will be attached here]
3. Power on the [microcontroller]
[We need a more user-friendly way to describe, such as “press the power button as shown below” and including a figure. This will be decided once we figure out the FINAL design with other teams. A diagram will be included]
4. Press “Okay” when your phone prompts you to connect to the microcontroller.
5. Periodically check your phone to calibrate the microcontroller.
6. You’re all set!
